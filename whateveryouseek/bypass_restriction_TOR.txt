# Bypass a blocked website with TOR 

This is a very note tutorial on accessing website blocked by your ISP, router 
or proxy. Download TOR Browser from any reliable source. 

If you are behind a proxy ensure to configure TOR browser with the proxy settings 
before connecting to the onion network. 

## Changing TOR proxy in startup

While TOR is trying to connect click cancel -> configure -> select I use a proxy to connect to internet 
Select the proxy type usually HTTP/HTTPS enter the proxy address and port, the port is usually 8080, 
makesure the proxy address does not start with protocol e.g `https://myproxy.com` is wrong, instead 
enter `myproxy.com` only. Then click connect. 

If you don't know your proxy settings open your PC settings and go to the proxy page. 
You will see the proxy settings there. 

Then you can access your internet with no hold back, TOR is a layer over the firefox browser hence 
whatever you can do in firefox you can do in TOR with privacy and security. you should be worried 
over firefox and chrome not TOR.The quieter you become the more you are able to hear.
